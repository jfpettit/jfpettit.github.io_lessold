I'm Jacob Pettit, I did my B.S. in [Scientific Computing](https://www.sc.fsu.edu/) at Florida State University. I'm currently working on machine learning research at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Long term, I'd like to try to understand cognition and develop intelligent machines. I'm also interested in meta-learning, knowledge representation, and reinforcement learning (RL).

In my free time, I love to surf, rock climb, and enjoy long hikes with my fiancee and our dogs. Feel free to explore my website, and you can contact me at either my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jacobpettit18) or [email](mailto:jfpettit@gmail.com). :)

I also write a newsletter on [Substack](https://themerge.substack.com), and will be more regularly posting there. You can subscribe below.
